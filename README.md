# UC Davis Projects
This is the repository for some of the works (labs, homeworks, projects) for the coursework in UC Davis. 
I expect myself to keep on updating and adding more coursework into it.

## Currently included works
+ EEC281 - VLSI Digital Signal Processing - Verilog and Matlab

## Works that are in other repositories
+ EEC201 - Digital Signal Processing - Matlab
   + Please refer to [henrrydegee/EEC201_Speaker_Recognition](https://github.com/henrrydegee/EEC201_Speaker_Recognition)

## To schoolmates
It's best for you to ask your TA or professor for answers rather than searching on the internet. Use this repo as 
a reference at your discretion. To anyone looking forward to plagarise, I've got two words for you: MOSS and SJA.
